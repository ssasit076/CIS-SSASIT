Code Innovation Series powered by GitHub

Here is the Prototype model of our project idea.

This is a responsive prototype of an app that will allow students from various branches to study and get materials that they might need for any competitve exam.
This app has exam papers of all the competitive exams in form of quizzes that students can take in form of exams.

This app runs with Google Firebase as a backend to handle users authentication, user data as well as a realtime database that will contain study and quizz data.
